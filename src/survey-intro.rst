ODK Survey
==============

.. _survey-intro:

:dfn:`ODK Survey` is an Android application for performing data collection in the ODK 2.0 framework. It operates similarly to ODK Collect, but is based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript rather than native Android, and is more flexible in its presentation and execution.

.. note::

  ODK Survey only works on Android 4.2 and newer devices.

.. note::

  ODK Survey cannot read or display the forms created for ODK Collect (that is, those created via ODK Build, XLSForm, or other form design tools). ODK Survey operates with ODK 2.0 *data management applications*.

We have included a sample application built on top of Survey to showcase some of its features.
