.. _usage-data-setting:

When enabled, ODK Collect sends anonymous usage and error data 
back to the ODK development team, 
which helps us improve the application.

.. _admin-settings:

Admin Settings
-----------------

Admin settings manage other settings and features,
letting you :doc:`import or export settings <collect-import-export>`,
:ref:`reset settings and delete cached data <reset-application>`, 
and :ref:`restrict which features are available to users of the app <user-access-control-settings>`.

Admin settings are useful when 
you are managing devices that will be used by many enumerators,
and you would like to limit the options available to those enumerators.

You can `password protect`__ the Admin setting screen,
so enumerators cannot adjust settings or access restricted features.

__ _admin-password

To access Admin settings:
  :menuselection:`⋮ --> Admin Settings`


.. image:: /img/collect-settings/admin-settings.*
  :alt: Admin settings menu
  :class: device-screen-vertical

  
:guilabel:`General Settings`
  Provides access to :ref:`general-settings`, 
  with all items unrestricted.

.. _admin-password:  
    
:guilabel:`Admin Password`
  Lets you password protect this screen.

.. _reset-application:
  
:guilabel:`Reset application`
  Lets you reset to default settings,
  delete forms, and empty caches.
  
:guilabel:`Import/Export settings`
  See:
  
  .. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
     
    collect-import-export

.. _user-access-control-settings:

.. rubric:: User Access Control Settings

:guilabel:`Main Menu Settings`
  Displays a list of :ref:`main-menu` features.
  To hide features, uncheck them.

:guilabel:`User Settings` 
  Displays a list of user settings and other features 
  accessible in the :ref:`general-settings` screen.
  To hide features, uncheck them.

:guilabel:`Form Entry Settings`
  Displays a list of features related to viewing and filling out forms.
  To disable features, uncheck them.

  :guilabel:`Moving backwards`
    If you disable moving backwards, 
    the enumerator cannot use the back button or :gesture:`swipe right`
    to move backwards through a form.
    
    However, disabling this feature 
    does not completely restrict a user's ability to access
    already-answered questions.
    So,
    when you uncheck this box to restrict backward movement,
    the app will suggest several additional restrictions
    which will prevent a non-admin user
    from revisiting already-asked questions:
  
    - Disable :guilabel:`Edit Saved Form` option in the main menu
    - Disable :guilabel:`Save Form` option in the Form entry menu
    - Disable :guilabel:`Go To Prompt` option in the Form entry menu
    - Set :guilabel:`Constraint processing` to validate upon forward swipe in the Form Management settings

    .. image:: /img/collect-settings/moving-backwards-disabled.*
      :alt: Image showing message displayed to configure other settings when Moving backwards option is unchecked.
      :class: device-screen-vertical
    
    Select :guilabel:`YES` to set these additional restrictions.
    
    .. note::

      When you enable the moving backwards option, 
      you have to configure the other changed settings 
      since they are not automatically changed back.
