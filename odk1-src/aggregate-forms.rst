.. note::

  Submissions in the Collect app are located under the /odk/instances directory on the phone's sdcard. This directory will contain subdirectories with names of the form in the format ``formID_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-MM-ss``. Within each of these subdirectories are the submission data file (``formID_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-MM-ss.xml``), and zero or more associated media files (images, audio, video) associated with this submission.
