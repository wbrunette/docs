.. _using-android-studio:

Using Android Studio
----------------------------

Android Studio is the official IDE for Android. It provides tools for building apps for every type of Android device. Android Emulator can be used to test your app virtually on any Android device configuration.

Follow the procedures given below to run your app on the emulator:

1. `Download Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads>`_ with SDK according to your platform.

2. Here is a `tutorial <https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html>`_ on how to set up Android Studio according to different platforms.

3. After installing, launch Android Studio and click on :guilabel:`Start a new Android Studio project` or if you have an existing project click on  :guilabel:`Open an existing Android Studio project`.

.. image:: /img/project-collect/android-studio.*

10. If you are an existing user list of all virtual devices would appear on the screen, to create a new virtual device, click on :guilabel:`+ Create Virtual Device...`

.. image:: /img/project-collect/avd-list.*
  :alt: Image showing list of virtual devices.

  
11. In the Select Hardware window, choose a device definition for your virtual device. I have chosen :guilabel:`Nexus 5`, click on :guilabel:`Next`.

14 Now you would be able to see your virtual device in Android Virtual Device Manager. Click on |run| to run your Android emulator.

.. |run| image:: /img/project-collect/run-icon.*
         :alt: image showing run icon

.. image:: /img/project-collect/update-virtual.*
  :alt: Image showing updated virtual devices  

  
.. note::
 
 Please wait for some time as Android emulator takes very long time to start.
 
15. After the emulator is started, you would be able to see the screen of your emulator. :

.. image:: /img/project-collect/emulator-screen1.*
  :alt: Image showing emulator screen.
   
16. Now click on |SDK| to see the location of Android SDK.

.. |SDK| image:: /img/project-collect/sdk-manager.*
         :alt: Image showing SDK manager icon
  
.. image:: /img/project-collect/emulator-screen.*
  :alt: Image showing SDK manager in the Android main window.
  
17. Open the terminal and move to the `platform-tools` of the `SDK` directory.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd platform-tools
  
18. Copy the :file:`collect.apk` into :file:`platform-tools` folder. You can `download <https://opendatakit.org/downloads/download-info/odk-collect-apk/>`_ the apk file from here.

19. Type the following command to see the list connected devices:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb devices

You should be able to see the emulator along with its port number, e.g emulator-5554, Here 5554 is the port number. If the emulator is not present in the list, restart the emulator.

To install apk file, in the emulator type the following command: 

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb install collect.apk
 
If the command is successfully executed, you will find your file in the launcher of your emulator.

.. _using-command-line:
  
Using Command Line 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also run the emulator using command line. Follow the steps given below to start your emulator using the command line:

.. note::

  If SDK installation has been put in another drive or folder instead of in its default location of ``$USER_HOME`` or ``$HOME``. Make sure you have set the environment variables according to that. In the command line type the following command to set environment variables.
  
  .. code-block:: console
  
    set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=path\sdk\


1. Open the terminal and move to the :file:`emulator` folder of the `SDK` directory.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd emulator
  
2. For the list of available virtual devices, type the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ emulator -list-avds
 
.. tip::

  If you are not able to locate :file:`emulator.exe` file in :file:`SDK` folder. Type the following command to know the location of the file:
  
  .. code-block:: console

    $ which emulator
  
  On Windows:
  
  .. code-block:: doscon

    > where emulator

3. Use :command:`emulator` to start the emulator. Here *avd_name* is the name of Android virtual device that you have created.

.. code-block:: console

  $ emulator -avd avd_name

.. note::
  
  1. You can use :command:`sdkmanager` command to update, install, and uninstall packages for the Android SDK. This method is not recommended as it is not   user-friendly and also takes time.

     To create an emulator you need to download system image for a particular API level.
	
    .. code-block:: console

      $ sdkmanager --verbose "system-images;android-19;google_apis;x86"
	  
	  
    - The :option:`--verbose` option or :option:`-v` option shows errors, warnings and all messages.
    - ``system-images;android-19;google_apis`` specifies the system image package for the Android virtual device.
    - ``android-19`` specifies the API level. You can choose different API level if you want.
   
  2. To create and manage Android Virtual device from the command line, you can use :command:`avdmanager`.
  
     After downloading system image, you can use the following command to create an emulator.
   
    .. code-block:: console

      $ avdmanager -v create avd --name testAVD -k "system-images;android-19;google_apis;x86" -g "google_apis"
	  
	 
    - The :option:`create avd` option creates a new Android virtual device.
    - :option:`--name` option is a **required** option which is used to specify name of the AVD. Here, the name of the AVD is testAVD.
    - The :option:`-g` specifies the sys-img tag to use for the AVD.
    - :option:`-k` specifies package path of the system image for the AVD.

  You can also use `Genymotion <https://www.genymotion.com/>`_ as an alternative as it is very fast as compared to custom android emulators. It is also easy to use and configure, and it is available free of cost for personal use.
