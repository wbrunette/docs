ODK Aggregate
===================

.. _aggregate-introduction:

:dfn:`ODK Aggregate` is an open source Java application that
stores, analyzes, and presents :doc:`XForm <form-design-intro>` survey data collected using :doc:`collect-intro` or other :doc:`OpenRosa-compliant applications <openrosa>`. It supports a wide range of data types, and is designed to work well in any hosting environment.

With Aggregate, data collection teams can:

- :doc:`Host <aggregate-forms>` blank :doc:`XForms <form-design-intro>` used by ODK Collect or other OpenRosa clients
- :doc:`Store and manage XForm submission data <aggregate-data>` 
- Visualize collected data using :doc:`maps <aggregate-visualize>` and :ref:`simple graphs <visualize-submissions>`
- :doc:`Export and publish data in a variety of formats <aggregate-data-access>`

Aggregate can be hosted on 
:doc:`Google App Engine <aggregate-app-engine>`,
:doc:`Amazon Web Services <aggregate-aws>`,
or :doc:`your own local or cloud server <aggregate-tomcat>`.
There's also a :doc:`pre-configured virtual machine image <aggregate-vm>`
that is ready to deploy on any computer.
