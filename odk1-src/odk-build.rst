.. _upload-forms:

Upload forms to Aggregate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can upload a form to Aggregate server by clicking on :menuselection:`Upload Form to Aggregate...` in the :guilabel:`File` menu. In the window which opens up, enter the url for your Aggregate server. In the username and password box, you need to enter your Aggregate account credentials with Form Manager or greater capabilities. The account type in Aggregate has to be ODK, not Google. You may leave these blank if your Aggregate instance allows anonymous form uploading.

.. _forms-export:

Export forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~   

- To view XML for your form, click on :menuselection:`Export to XML...` in the :guilabel:`File` menu. You can download the :file:`.xml` file for your form by clicking on :guilabel:`Download` option in the output XML window.

.. image:: /img/odk-build/download-xml.png

- You can download :file:`.xlsx` file for your form by clicking on :menuselection:`Export to XLSForm` in the :guilabel:`File` menu.

.. _form-properties:

Changing form properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the form properties by clicking :menuselection:`Form Properties...` in the :guilabel:`Edit` menu. 

.. image:: /img/odk-build/edit-menu.png
   :alt: Image showing edit menu dropdown.

A form properties window will appear, where you can enter the instance name, public key and submission url for your form. 

.. image:: /img/odk-build/form-properties.png
   :alt: Image showing form properties window.

Instance name specifies names you want to give to submitted data. You can see more info on public key :ref:`here <construct-key>`. Submission url directs your submissions somewhere other than the Aggregate that supplied the form. This is the ODK Aggregate website url with ``Aggregate.html`` replaced by submission.

.. tip::

  You can give an instance name which uses calculated expressions to name submissions based on submission data. Note that whatever you put in the instance name box should evaluate to a string.

  For example, you might use a concatenation of a unique student ID (sid) with the student name (s_name) as the name of the filled-in form. So you can provide a instance name as : **concat(${sid},' - ', ${s_name})**.
  
  This is implemented in XML as an instanceName field within the meta block. If this value is present and not an empty string (""), it will be used as the name of the filled-in form. Otherwise, the current default naming, based upon the date the form was first saved, will be used.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <instance>
      <data id="build_example1_1508999324">
        <meta>
          <instanceID/>
          <instanceName/>
        </meta>
        <s_name/>
        <sid/>
      </data>
    </instance>   

  .. figure:: /img/odk-build/instance-name.png
    :alt: Image showing instance name according to submitted data.   

    Instance name as **sid-s_name: 12345-Ankita**  

.. _manage-translation:
