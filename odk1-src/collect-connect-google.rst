5. **Optional:** Set a :guilabel:`Fallback submission URL`

   When using Collect with a Google account, form submissions will be posted to a Google Sheet specified in the form. 

   You have the option to specify a :guilabel:`Fallback submisison URL`. This is the URL of a Google sheet to which form submissions will be posted if the submitted form does not specify its own URL.

   If your forms will specify a submission URL, you can leave this setting empty. Otherwise, enter the URL of a Google sheet you would like to use.
