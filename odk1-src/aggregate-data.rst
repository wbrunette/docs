Working with Submitted Data in Aggregate
=========================================

You can view the data submitted from ODK Collect here. You can filter the submissions, visualize them using pie chart, bar graph or map, export the submissions into useful formats and publish the submitted data into another service. You can also view all the exported submissions. ODK Aggregate provides all these options under the :guilabel:`Submissions` tab.

.. _filter-submission:

Filtering Submissions
------------------------

Submissions from ODK collect can be filtered to view or hide a specific subset of data by creation of filters. Filters give you the ability to see a subset of your data. You can have a single filter as well as multiple filters. If you have multiple filters applied at once, then you have a filter group. You can create and apply filters by using the options under the :guilabel:`Filter Submissions` tab.

You can create a single or multiple filters depending on the subset of data you want to view or hide. Creating a filter like `Display Rows where column Gender EQUAL male` specifies that you want to get a list of all rows where gender column has value as male i.e you want to obtain information about all male people in your data. Unless the filter is saved, it is temporary. You can save a filter to make it permanent. Any filter can be deleted if it is no longer needed.

Various options under this tab can be used as follows:

- Click on :guilabel:`Add Filter` to add filter to the data. In the :guilabel:`Create filter to` dropdown, :menuselection:`Display` or :menuselection:`Hide` will specify whether you will be selecting data to show or hide and  :menuselection:`Rows` or :menuselection:`Columns` will specify whether you will be working with the rows or columns of the table.

- Click on :guilabel:`Delete` to delete a filter or filter group.
- You can check the :guilabel:`Display Metadata` checkbox to display or hide metadata.

Visualizing Submissions
---------------------------

ODK Aggregate provides a quick means for basic data visualization. This Visualize functionality is meant to provide a quick means to view early data results in meaningful ways but is not meant to provide complex data analysis functionality. You can view your data in bar graph, pie chart or on a map. 

In both Pie chart and bar graph visualization you can either count the number of times a unique answer occurs in a specified column or calculate sum of values in one column grouped by a value in another column. You can choose a column that you want to map in map visualization.

.. image:: /img/aggregate-use/visualize.*
   :alt: Image showing visualize option.

Click on :guilabel:`Visualize` to visualize the submitted data. Select bar graph, pie chart or map in the :guilabel:`Type` dropdown. Further options are described as follows:

- If you choose Pie Chart, choose whether you would like to count or sum data:

      - If you select :guilabel:`Count` option, then select the column in which you want to apply this.
      - If you select :guilabel:`Sum` option, then select the column of values that you want to add and another column that you want to use to group the numbers. 
      - Then click on :guilabel:`Pie It` to get the Pie Chart.
