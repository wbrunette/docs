Administering Aggregate
===========================

Click the :guilabel:`Log In` link in the upper right corner of the screen to be presented with the Log onto Aggregate screen. Choose the :guilabel:`Sign in with Aggregate password` button and enter the super-user username you specified within the installer. The initial password for this account is `aggregate`. When you log in, :guilabel:`Site Admin` will be visible to you.

.. tip::

   - When signing in with this method, if you do not enter the password correctly, you may need to close all your browser windows and quit your browser before you can try again.
   - If the instance name of the server changes (the installer asks for this name), then the passwords for all ODK Aggregate usernames will be cleared (preventing their use) and the super-user username's password will be reset to aggregate and the above message will also be displayed. In this case, you should log in, change the super-user's password, and change the passwords for all of your ODK Aggregate usernames.
   - In April 2015, the use of Google e-mail accounts for accessing the site (via Sign in with Google) stopped working (Google turned off that functionality).  If you have an existing site running an old version of ODK Aggregate that does not have ODK Aggregate usernames configured for website access (and offers a Sign in with Google sign-in choice), you will need to upgrade to regain access to it.

.. note:: 

 Beginning with ODK Aggregate 1.3.2, upon the initial installation of the server, it is configured to allow unauthenticated (`anonymousUser`) submissions from ODK Collect and unauthenticated browser access to the submissions and forms management functionality of ODK Aggregate.

If you have not yet changed your super-user password to something other than `aggregate`, the server will display **This server and its data are not secure! Please change the super-user's password!** at the top of the web page.

Please visit the :guilabel:`Permissions` sub-tab under the :guilabel:`Site Admin` tab to change this user's password.

You can specify additional usernames with browser access to the server under the :guilabel:`Permissions` sub-tab. Privileges are as follows:

- **Data Collector**: able to download forms to ODK Collect and submit data from ODK Collect to ODK Aggregate. 

.. note::

   - Only ODK accounts and the anonymousUser can be granted Data Collector rights. 
   - The anonymousUser must be granted Data Collector rights to accept submissions from unidentified sources (e.g., from ODK Collect 1.1.5 and earlier, or from ODK Collect 1.1.7 and later if not authenticating).

- **Data Viewer**: able to log onto the ODK Aggregate website, filter and view submissions, and generate csv or kml files for download.
- **Form Manager**: all the capabilities of a Data Viewer plus the abilities to upload a form definition, delete a form and its data, and upload submissions manually through the ODK Aggregate website.
- **Site Administrator**: all the capabilities of a Form Manager plus the ability to add users, set passwords, and grant these capabilities to other users.
