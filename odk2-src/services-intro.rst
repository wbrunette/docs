ODK Services
==============

.. _services-intro:

:dfn:`ODK Services` is a program that handles database access, file access, and data synchronization services between all the ODK 2.0 applications. Mostly this happens behind the scenes, but you will need to install ODK Services as a prerequisite to using the other ODK 2.0 tools.

It also allows you to sync data collected by the ODK 2.0 tools with an ODK Cloud Endpoint. The Services application can be used to reset the Cloud Endpoint with the data that is on a tablet or to sync the data on the tablet with what is currently on the Cloud Endpoint.
